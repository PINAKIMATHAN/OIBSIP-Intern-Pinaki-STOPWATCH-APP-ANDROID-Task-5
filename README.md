During my internship, I successfully developed a Stopwatch app using Android Studio, demonstrating my proficiency in mobile application development. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in implementing user interfaces, handling time-sensitive functionalities, and debugging code efficiently. My contribution to the app showcased my dedication to learning and adapting to new technologies within the realm of software development as per the task of Oasis Infobyte i.e., Android App Development ----TASK-5.
